## Testing

The project includes a Docker-based test setup for end-to-end testing of the bot's functionality.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- A test Discord bot token
- A test channel ID for logging

### Setup Test Environment

1. Create a `.env.test` file with your test credentials:
   ```
   TEST_DISCORD_TOKEN=your_test_bot_token_here
   TEST_LOG_CHANNEL_ID=your_test_channel_id_here
   ```

2. Run the tests using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build
   ```

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes:
- Voice channel join events
- Voice channel leave events
- Voice channel switch events

Each test verifies that the bot sends the correct formatted message to the logging channel.

### Running Tests Locally
